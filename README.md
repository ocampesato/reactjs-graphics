================

This repository contains an assortment of code samples that illustrate how to create SVG-based graphics effects using ReactJS.

This swatch-like collection contains many code samples that contain minor variations of colors or shapes, and they are included in this project for your convenience.

The code samples in the subdirectories are based on various polar equations, such as Archimedean spirals, Cissoids, Cochleoids, Conchoids, Lissajous curves, and Lituus curves.

Additional graphics code samples involving CSS3, HTML5 Canvas, D3, and jQuery/CSS3 are here:
